# NodeWordGuess

## How To
 * Use programmer-recursionArray.js (07-Programmers Loop) to push new letter into `dashes[]`
 * If/while the number of guesses is greater than 0, let this run (teamManager.js - playgame initialization)
* answer.whatever = user_guess -- if word.includes(user_guess), then replace dash with letter
